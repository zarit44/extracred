  "description": "This is a word constructor guessing game. The computer will choose a word from my array. Then, you will choose any lower case letter to begin playing. You enter a letter and the computer will then check, like the hangman game, if the letter guessed is part of the word given. You have 10 tries. If you choose the same letter twice, the computer will tell you to choose another letter. If you win, it will let you know. If you lose, it will also let you know. It then will prompt you with either restarting a new game with a different word or exit the game.",
